# Start All TCK Tests with Docker 🐳

This guide will help you set up and start the TCK server, local node and run all TKC tests using Docker. Follow these steps to ensure all dependencies are installed and the server runs smoothly.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: Version 20 or higher
- **npm**: Version 10 or higher
- **Docker**: Latest version
- **Docker Compose**: Latest version

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. Check Node.js and npm

Verify that Node.js and npm are installed and meet the version requirements:

npm -v
```

### 2. Install Hedera Local Node CLI

If not already installed, run the following command:

```bash
npm install @hashgraph/hedera-local -g

```bash
task build-tck-js-server
```

### 5. Start All Services

Now, let’s fire up all the services using Docker Compose:

```bash
task start-all-tests
```

This will:

- Spin up the TCK server

- Start required containers

- Run all tests automatically

Sit back and let Docker do the magic!

### 🎉 All Done!

Your TCK server is now running inside Docker! 🚀 You can now execute tests and validate the system.
