-   `*Id.toString()` no longer stringifies with checksums. Use `*Id.getChecksum()` to get the checksum that was parsed, or use `*Id.toStringWithChecksum(client)` to stringify with the correct checksum for that ID on the client's network.
-   `*Id.validateChecksum()` to validate a checksum. Throws new `BadEntityIdException`

### Fixed

-   Free queries should not longer attempt to sign payment transactions
-   All enitty IDs within response should no longer contain a checskum.
    Use `*Id.toStringWithChecksum(Client)` to stringify with a checksum
-   `ReceiptStatusError` should contain a properly filled out `TransactionReceipt`

### Deprecated

-   `*Id.validate()` use `*Id.validateChecksum()` instead

## v2.0.26

### Changed

-   Updated `Status` and `FeeDataType` with new codes

## v2.0.25

### Added

-   `TokenCreateTransaction.[get|set]FeeScheduleKey()`
-   Support for parsing file 0.0.111 using `FeeSchedules`

### Fixed

-   `TokenMintTransaction.[to|from]Bytes()` incorrectly parsing the transaction body

### Removed

-   `TokenCreateTransaction.addCustomFee()` - use `TokenCreateTransaction.setCustomFees()` instead

## v2.0.25-beta.1

-   `PrivateKey.legacyDerive()` should now be consistent with the v1.4.6 JS SDK

## v2.0.24

### Added

-   `Hbar.fromTinybar()` supports `BigNumber`
-   `Hbar.toString()` supports `HbarUnit`
-   Implemented to and from bytes for `TopicInfo` and `TokenInfo`
-   Support for `sign-on-demand`
    -   This is disabled by default to you'll need to enable it using `Client.setSignOnDemand(true)`
    -   If `sign-on-demand` is enabled you'll need to use `async` versions of these methods:
        -   `*Transaction.toBytes()` -> `*Transaction.toBytesAsync()`
        -   `*Transaction.getSignatures()` -> `*Transaction.getSignaturesAsync()`
        -   `*Transaction.getTransactionHash()` -> `*Transaction.getTransactionHashAsync()`

### Changes

-   All requests now retry on gRPC status `INTERNAL` if error returned contains `RST_STREAM`

-   Implemented `*Id.clone()` (this is used internally to fix some issues that only surface in React Native)
-   Implement `Timestamp.plusNanos()`
-   Added support for entity ID checksums. The network will be extracted from the checksum of the
    entity ID and validated on each request to make sure a request is not happening on one network
    while an entity ID references another network. Entity IDs with a network will print with a checksum
    while entity IDs without a checksum will not print the checksum part.

### Fixed

-   `TopicMessageQuery.startTime` not updating start time by one nanosecond causing a message to appear twice
    if the connection reset
-   `TopicMessageQuery` should log retries
-   `TransactionReceipt` error handling; this should now throw an error contain the receipt

## v2.0.22

### Fixed

-   `TopicMessageQuery.maxBackoff` was not being used at all
-   `TopicMessageQuery.limit` was being incorrectly update with full `TopicMessages` rather than per chunk
-   `TopicMessageQuery.startTime` was not being updated each time a message was received
-   `TopicMessageQuery.completionHandler` was be called at incorrect times

## v2.0.21

### Added

-   Exposed `AccountBalance.tokenDecimals`
-   Support for `string` parameters in `Hbar.fromTinybars()`
-   `Hbar.toBigNumber()` which is a simple wrapper around `Hbar.to(HbarUnit.Hbar)`
-   `AccountBalance.toJSON()`
-   Support for `maxBackoff`, `maxAttempts`, `retryHandler`, and `completionHandler` in `TopicMessageQuery`
-   Default logging behavior to `TopicMessageQuery` if an error handler or completion handler was not set

### Fixed

-   `TopicMessageQuery` retry handling; this should retry on more gRPC errors
-   `TopicMessageQuery` max retry timeout; before this would could wait up to 4m with no feedback
-   Missing `@readonly` tag on `TokenInfo.tokenMemo`
-   `Keystore` failing to recognize keystores generated by v1 SDKs

-   `Hbar.toBigNumber()` aliases `Hbar.to(HbarUnit.Hbar)`
-   `AccountBalance.tokenDecimals` - Represents the decimals on a token
-   `AccountBalance.toString()` should print a `JSON.stringified()` output
-   `AccountBalance.toJSON()`

### Changed

-   `Mnemonic.toLegacyPrivateKey()` no longer automaticaly derives `PrivateKey`, instead produces root `PrivateKey`
    Use `PrivateKey.legacyDerive()` to derive the proper `PrivateKey` manually
-   Removed the use of `@hashgraph/protobufjs` in favor of `protobufjs`
    The reason `@hashgraph/protobufjs` even exists is because `protobufjs` contains `eval`
    which fails CSP in browser. However, while running integration tests through `vite` and
    `mocha` it seems the `eval` was never hit.
-   Moved from `yarn` to `pnpm` because of performance issues with `yarn`

## v2.0.19

### Added

-   Scheduled transaction support: `ScheduleCreateTransaction`, `ScheduleDeleteTransaction`, and `ScheduleSignTransaction`
-   React Native support
-   Support for raw `proto.Transaction` bytes in `Transaction.fromBytes()`
    -   This means v1 SDK's `Transaction.toBytes()` will now be supported in v2 `Transaction.fromBytes()`
        However, `Transaction.toBytes()` and `Transaction.getTransactionHas()` in v2 will produce different
        results in the v1 SDK's.

### Fixed

-   addSignature() Behavior Differs Between Implementations [NCC-E001154-005]
-   Decreased `CHUNK_SIZE` 4096->1024 and increased default max chunks 10->20

    -   `TokenInfoQuery.tokenMemo`

### Fixed

-   `ScheduleInfo.*ID` field names should use `Id`
    Ex. `ScheduleInfo.creatorAccountID` -> `ScheduleInfo.creatorAccountId`
-   Renamed `ScheduleInfo.memo` -> `ScheduleInfo.scheduleMemo`
-   Chunked transactions should not support scheduling if the data provided is too large
    -   `TopicMessageSubmitTransaction`

    * All queries and transactions support setting fields in the constructor using
      an object, e.g. `new AccountBalanceQuery({ accountId: "0.0.3" })`, or
      `new AccountCreateTransaction({ key: client.operatorPublicKey, initialBalance: 10 })`.
    * Almost all instances of `BigNumber` have been replaced with `Long`

## v1.1.12

### Fixed

-   `Ed25519PrivateKey.fromMnemonic` regressed in v1.1.8 and was not working in the browser.

-   Use detached signatures when signing the transaction. This should allow for much larger transactions to be submitted.

## v1.1.11

### Fixed

-   `Ed25519PrivateKey.fromKeystore` regressed in v1.1.9 and was not working in the browser

## v1.1.10

### Deprecated

-   Deprecates `Client.maxTransactionFee` and `Client.maxQueryPayment` getters.

-   Deprecates `ConsensusTopicCreateTransaction.setAutoRenewAccount()` was simply
    renamed to `ConsensusTopicCreateTransaction.setAutoRenewAccountId()`.

-   Deprecates `ConsensusTopicCreateTransaction.setExpirationTime()` with no replacement.

-   Deprecates `ConsensusTopicCreateTransaction.setValidStart()` with no replacement.

-   Deprecates `ConsensusTopicUpdateTransaction.setAutoRenewAccount()` with no replacement.

## v1.1.8

### Fixed

-   `TransactionRecord.getContractCallResult` and `TransactionRecord.getContractExecuteResult` were swapped
    internally and neither worked before.

-   Export `ConsensusMessageSubmitTransaction`.

## v1.1.7

### Fixed

-   Do not provide (and sign) a payment transaction for `AccountBalanceQuery`. It is not required.

## v1.1.6

### Added

-   Add `TransactionBuilder.getCost()` to return a very close estimate of the transaction fee (within 1%).

-   Add additional error classes to allow more introspection on errors:

    -   `HederaPrecheckStatusError` - Thrown when the transaction fails at the node (the precheck)
    -   `HederaReceiptStatusError` - Thrown when the receipt is checked and has a failing status. The error object contains the full receipt.
    -   `HederaRecordStatusError` - Thrown when the record is checked and it has a failing status. The error object contains the full record.

-   `console.log(obj)` now prints out nice debug information for several types in the SDK including receipts

## v1.1.5

### Added

-   Add `TransactionReceipt.getConsensusTopicId()`.

-   Add `TransactionReceipt.getConsensusTopicRunningHash()`.

-   Add `TransactionReceipt.getConsensusTopicSequenceNumber()`.

-   Deprecates `ConsensusSubmitMessageTransaction`. This was renamed to `ConsensusMessageSubmitTransaction` to
    match the Java SDK.

## v1.1.2

### Fixed

-   https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-sdk-js/issues/175

-   Add `MirrorClient` and `MirrorConsensusTopicQuery` which can be used to listen for HCS messages from a mirror node.

### Changed

Minor version bumps may add deprecations as we improve parity between SDKs
or fix reported issues. Do not worry about upgrading in a timely manner. All v1+ APIs
will be continuously supported.

-   Deprecated `SystemDelete#setId`; replaced with `SystemDelete#setFileId` or `SystemDelete#setContractId`

-   Deprecated `SystemUndelete#setId`; replaced with `SystemUndelete#setFileId` or `SystemUndelete#setContractId`

-   Deprecated `Hbar.of(val)`; replaced with `new Hbar(val)`

    -   `ValidationError` becomes `LocalValidationError`
    -   `TinybarValueError` becomes `HbarRangeError`
    -   `MaxPaymentExceededError` becomes `MaxQueryPaymentExceededError`
    -   `BadKeyError` is a new exception type when attempting to parse or otherwise use a key that doesn't look like a key

### Added

-   Add support for unsigned integers (incl. Arrays) for contract encoding and decoding

-   Add `AccountUpdateTransaction.setReceiverSignatureRequired`

-   Add `AccountUpdateTransaction.setProxyAccountId`

### Changed

-   Rename `ContractExecuteTransaction.setAmount()` to `ContractExecuteTransaction.setPayableAmount()`

## v1.0.0-beta.4

### Added

-   `Client.forTestnet` makes a new client configured to talk to TestNet (use `.setOperator` to set an operater)

-   `Client.forMainnet` makes a new client configured to talk to Mainnet (use `.setOperator` to set an operater)

### Changed

-   Renamed `TransactionReceipt.accountId`, `TransactionReceipt.contractId`, `TransactionReceipt.fileId`, and
    `TransactionReceipt.contractId` to `TransactionReceipt.getAccountId()`, etc. to add an explicit illegal
    state check as these fields are mutually exclusive

-   Renamed `TransactionRecord.contractCallResult` to `TransactionRecord.getContractExecuteResult()`

-   Renamed `TransactionRecord.contractCreateResult` to `TransactionRecord.getContractCreateResult()`

## v1.0.0-beta.3

### Changed

-   `TransactionBuilder.setMemo` is renamed to `TransactionBuilder.setTransactionMemo` to avoid confusion
    as there are 2 other kinds of memos on transactions

### Fixed

-   Fix usage on Node versions less than 12.x

## v1.0.0-beta.2

### Changed

-   `CallParams` is removed in favor of `ContractFunctionParams` and closely mirrors type names from solidity

    -   `addInt32`
    -   `addInt256Array`
    -   `addString`
    -   etc.

-   `ContractFunctionResult` now closely mirrors the solidity type names

    -   `getInt32`
    -   etc.

-   `setFunctionParams(params)` on `ContractCallQuery` and `ContractExecuteTransaction` is now
    `setFunction(name, params)`

-   `ContractLogInfo.topicList` -> `ContractLogInfo.topics`

-   `FileInfo.deleted` -> `FileInfo.isDeleted`

-   `FileContentsQuery.execute` now directly returns `Uint8Array`

-   `ContractRecordsQuery.execute` now directly returns `TransactionRecord[]`

-   `AccountAmount.amount` (`String`) -> `AccountAmount.amount` (`Hbar`)

-   TransactionReceipt
    -   `receiverSigRequired` -> `isReceiverSignatureRequired`
    -   `autoRenewPeriodSeconds` -> `autoRenewPeriod`

### Fixed

-   Remove incorrect local validation for FileCreateTransaction and FileUpdateTransaction

-   Any `key` fields on response types (e.g., `AccountInfo`) are
    now `PublicKey` and can be any of the applicable key types

-   Fix transaction back-off when BUSY is returned

-   Default autoRenewPeriod on ContractCreate appropriately

## v0.8.0-beta.3

### Changed

-   Client constructor takes the network as `{ network: ... }` instead of `{ nodes: ... }`

-   Transactions and queries do not take `Client` in the constructor; instead, `Client` is passed to `execute`.

-   Removed `Transaction.executeForReceipt` and `Transaction.executeForRecord`

    These methods have been identified as harmful as they hide too much. If one fails, you do not know if the transaction failed to execute; or, the receipt/record could not be retrieved. In a mission-critical application, that is, of course, an important distinction.

    Now there is only `Transaction.execute` which returns a `TransactionId`. If you don't care about waiting for consensus or retrieving a receipt/record in your application, you're done. Otherwise you can now use any `TransactionId` and ask for the receipt/record (with a stepped retry interval until consensus) with `TransactionId.getReceipt` and `TransactionId.getRecord`.

    v0.7.x and below

    ```js
    let newAccountId = new AccountCreateTransaction(hederaClient)
        .setKey(newKey.publicKey)
        .setInitialBalance(1000)
        .executeForReceipt().accountId; // TransactionReceipt
    ```

    v0.8.x and above

    ```js
    let newAccountId = new AccountCreateTransaction()
        .setKey(newKey.publicKey)
        .setInitialBalance(1000)
        .execute(hederaClient) // TranactionId
        .getReceipt(hederaClient).accountId; // TransactionReceipt
    ```

-   Rename `setPaymentDefault` to `setPaymentAmount`

### Added

-   All transaction and query types that were in the Java SDK but not yet in the JS SDK (GetBySolidityIdQuery, AccountStakersQuery, etc.)

-   `TransactionId.getReceipt`

-   `TransactionId.getRecord`

-   `Transaction.toString`. This will dump the transaction (incl. the body) to a stringified JSON object representation of the transaction. Useful for debugging.

-   A default of 1 Hbar is now set for both maximum transaction fees and maximum query payments.

-   Smart Contract type encoding and decoding to match Java.

-   To/From string methods on AccountId, FileId, etc.

-   Internal retry handling for Transactions and Queries (incl. BUSY)

### Removed

-   `Transaction` and `Query` types related to claims
