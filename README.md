# Hedera Hashgraph Javascript/Typescript SDK

> The Javascript/Typescript SDK for interacting with [Hedera Hashgraph]: the official distributed consensus
> platform built using the hashgraph consensus algorithm for fast, fair and secure
> transactions. Hedera enables and empowers developers to build an entirely new
> class of decentralized applications.

## Usage

This SDK supports both running in the browser (with Webpack) and in Node.

(Code examples using `await` assume an `async` context.)

#### Installation
```shell script
# with NPM
$ npm install --save @hashgraph/sdk
# with Yarn
$ yarn add @hashgraph/sdk
```

#### Creating a client
```typescript
import {Client} from "@hashgraph/sdk";

const client = new Client({ 
    // this key defaults to this url, a public free proxy to the Hedera public testnet
    // generously hosted by MyHederaWallet.com
    url: "https://grpc-web.myhederawallet.com",
    operator: {
        // the account which signs transactions and query payments by default
        account: { shard: 0, realm: 0, account: ___ },
        // the private key used to sign the transactions, either encoded as a string
        // or as an `Ed25519PrivateKey` type 
        privateKey: "..."
    },
});
```

#### Checking your balance
```typescript
console.log('current account balance:', await client.getAccountBalance());
```

#### Sending a transfer
```typescript
// the amount parameter can either be a `number` or a bignumber.js type
await client.transferCryptoTo({ shard: 0, realm: 0, account: ___ }, 10_000_000);
```

#### Creating a new Account
```typescript
import {Ed25519PrivateKey} from "@hashgraph/sdk";

// generate a new, cryptographically random private key
const privateKey = await Ed25519PrivateKey.generate();
const publicKey = privateKey.publicKey;

// second parameter is optional initial balance for new account, transferred from operator account
const newAccount = await client.createAccount(publicKey, 10_000_000);

console.log('new account: ', newAccount, 'public key: ', publicKey.toString(), ' private key: ', privateKey.toString());
```

## Development

To build the SDK from source, you must have the official Protobufs compiler, `protoc`, installed:

Arch (with Pikaur):
```shell script
# Pacman
$ sudo pacman -S protobuf
# with Pikaur
$ pikaur -S protobuf
```

Ubuntu/Debian:
```shell script
# libprotobuf-dev contains the Protobuf definitions for standard types
$ sudo apt-get install protobuf-compiler libprotobuf-dev
```

### Hosting your own Envoy Proxy

This SDK talks to Hedera Hashgraph through [the gRPC-Web protocol] which allows it to function
in a browser. By default, the SDK points to a public free proxy that connects through to
`0.testnet.hedera.com:50211`. If you want to change this endpoint or simply host your own proxy,
a script to easily start an Envoy proxy in Docker is provided:

```shell script
# this script assumes that `envoy.yaml` is in the current working directory
$ ./scripts/start-envoy.sh
```

You can modify the endpoint to connect to in `envoy.yaml`.

[the gRPC-Web protocol]: https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/PROTOCOL-WEB.md

#### Updating Protobufs
If the protobuf files are ever found to be out of sync, you can update them easily as follows:
```shell script
$ ./scripts/update-protos.sh
```

This will temporarily clone https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-protobuf and copy the protobufs from
there.

#### NOTE: some Protobufs have to be manually patched
In most places where `sint64` or `uint64` is used in the protobufs, they have to be patched
to annotate these fields as `[jstype=JS_STRING]` or the Protobufs-JS library will try to decode
them as JS `number` types which can only represent exact integers in the range `[-2^53, 2^53 - 1]`.

(This is only really necessary for values which may conceivably fall outside that range, like 
tinybar amounts. We're assuming for now that shard/realm/entity numbers will not exceed this range 
for a very long time.)

Since `update-protos.sh` will inevitably clobber these modifications, it has the feature of
automatically applying patches defined in `patches` to the files in `src/protos` after overwriting.
These patch files have the original filename and extension and then an additional `.patch` 
extension, e.g. `src/protos/CryptoCreate.proto` has a patch file at the path 
`patches/CryptoCreate.proto.patch`.

If you find a **new** file needs to be modified, you can make the modification in `src/protos`, and 
**before committing it**, run the following:

```shell script
$ git diff src/proto/[proto file] > patches/[proto file].patch 
```

Then check-in the `.patch` file that was created and commit it as well as the change to the Protobuf
file. Your modification will then be preserved across `update-protos.sh` runs.

If you need to add modifications to an **existing** patch file, you need to recreate the patch file
that contains both existing modifications as well as new modifications. If you run into this and
don't know how to proceed, don't be afraid to ask for help.
