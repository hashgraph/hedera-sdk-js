/**
 * A call to a hedera smart contract, wrapping a foreign call format (such as Ethereum "type 2"
 * transactions). Gas, nonce, hbar amount, and contract ID are extracted in this object. A pointer
 * to the function parameters into the wrapped tx is also extracted.
 *
 * Call a function of the given smart contract instance, giving it functionParameters as its inputs.
 * The call can use at maximum the given amount of gas – the paying account will not be charged for
 * any unspent gas.
 *
 * If this function results in data being stored, an amount of gas is calculated that reflects this
 * storage burden.
 *
 * The amount of gas used, as well as other attributes of the transaction, e.g. size, number of
 * signatures to be verified, determine the fee for the transaction – which is charged to the paying
 * account.
